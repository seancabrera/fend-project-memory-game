## Instructions

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

Udacity provided starter code containing some HTML and CSS to display a static version of the game (basic UI in place, but no user interaction). I added the necessary Javascript, HTML and CSS to make the game work.
